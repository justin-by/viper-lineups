# Viper Lineups

Live Site: http://www.viperpostplants.com/

Viper Lineups is a web application which presents tested and effective lineups for anyone to use. This website features lineups for all the current maps in the game Valorant, displaying both videos and reference images to make the process of learning a lineup extremely quick.

## Lineups Page

Upon selecting a map, the user is brought to a page where lineups associated with that chosen map are displayed. Videos created for each lineup were uploaded onto a YouTube channel and are individually displayed on each page. The right side displays two zoomed images, the first instructing where to stand and the second referencing where to aim.

## So what are lineups?
In simple terms, lineups allow a player to use abilities on enemies without being detected. Lineups are used and created by using the environment to place lineups consistently. This grants characters like Viper the ability to control and protect a site from a safe location. This is a powerful strategy in the game that allows Viper to do a lot while risking very little.

### Message and Future Plans

Although being a fairly simple website, this project was super meaningful for me to develop. Right before I started my journey as a software engineer, Valorant was released. I remember spending the night opening a google doc, listing down all of the lineups I could research and find for my favorite agent, Viper. After developing a couple of projects I realized that this would be the perfect opportunity to develop a website displaying what I wanted to portray several months ago. Not only was this a fun and exciting passion project of mine, but this solves a problem many others and I encounter. It can be difficult to learn and remember lineups for any character, especially during a match. Many resources online, majorly being YouTube videos, tend to have longer instructions. I wanted to create something that represented a quick and simple portfolio of my favorite lineups that anyone could quickly visit to learn.

I plan to continue working on this website in the future. As I continue playing, I'll probably discover additional lineups or ideas to implement.
- Page introducing what lineups are
- Additional / reworking lineups
- Include lineups that aren't strictly for post plants / Defending side
